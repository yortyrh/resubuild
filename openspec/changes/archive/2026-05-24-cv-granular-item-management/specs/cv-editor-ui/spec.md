## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: CV section tabs SHALL use resume-preview rows for listed entity types

For Basics (excluding Social profiles tab), Work, Volunteer, Education, Skills, Projects, Awards, Certificates, Publications, Languages, Interests, and References, the editor SHALL render saved entries using resume-preview row components (bold primary text left, dates and locations right, bullet lists for highlights and courses) instead of always-visible card forms.

#### Scenario: Work section preview layout

- **WHEN** a user views the Work tab with saved entries
- **THEN** each job SHALL show position and company emphasis, date range and location on the right, and highlight bullets beneath the title block

#### Scenario: Skills section preview layout

- **WHEN** a user views the Skills tab
- **THEN** each skill SHALL show name and level in a compact resume line with keywords rendered as inline comma-separated or tag-like text consistent with the sample CV

#### Scenario: References section preview layout

- **WHEN** a user views the References tab with saved entries
- **THEN** each reference SHALL show the contact name emphasized with the reference text displayed beneath in resume-appropriate prose layout

### Requirement: Section interactions SHALL follow view, inline edit, bottom create, and confirmed delete patterns

The editor SHALL provide Edit actions on view rows that swap to inline forms until Save or Cancel; Add actions that reveal create forms fixed at the section bottom; and Delete actions gated by a confirmation dialog. Save and Delete SHALL trigger immediate API calls per `cv-item-crud`.

#### Scenario: Cancel edit restores view

- **WHEN** a user clicks Cancel while editing an education entry
- **THEN** the form SHALL close without calling the update API and the prior view row SHALL reappear unchanged

### Requirement: TagsInput SHALL be the sole editor for keyword and role string lists

Skills keywords, Interests keywords, Projects keywords, and Projects roles SHALL use the shared TagsInput component. The editor MUST NOT provide separate array repeaters or distinct components for keywords versus roles.

#### Scenario: Project roles and keywords

- **WHEN** a user edits a project in form mode
- **THEN** roles and keywords fields SHALL both use TagsInput with appropriate labels

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sparse categorical fields MUST receive contextual hints

The editor SHALL augment field bindings with succinct helper/description lines on **view and form** states where applicable. Hints remain required for Work (Summary, Description, Highlights), Education (Area, Study type), Skills (Name, Level), Projects (Entity, Type, Highlights), Awards, Certificates, Publications, Interests (Name), and References (Name, Reference text). TagsInput fields for keywords and roles SHOULD include brief guidance that values are comma-separated tags saved with the parent entry.

#### Scenario: Work summary clarity

- **WHEN** a user focuses Work summary in edit form
- **THEN** surfaced hint SHALL communicate it is a 2–3 sentence professional elevator pitch for that role

#### Scenario: Skills level clarity

- **WHEN** a user focuses Skill level in edit form
- **THEN** surfaced hint SHOULD communicate meaningful scale cues without implying enum lock-in contradictory to schema
