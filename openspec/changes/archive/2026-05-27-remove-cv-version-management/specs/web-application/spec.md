## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The web app MUST use backend-owned HTTP endpoints for authentication and authenticated Nest API access

Interactive client bundles (`'use client'` modules and hooks) SHALL NOT import `@supabase/ssr`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, or environment variables scoped for Supabase browser clients for authentication. Session establishment, credential verification, logout, renewal, and user resolution for SPA purposes SHALL occur exclusively through documented HTTP endpoints on the Nest API origin identified by `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. The API origin **MAY differ** from the web origin; Nest **SHALL** enable **CORS** allowing the web origin and required methods and headers (including `Authorization` and `Content-Type`) for these calls. Next.js Route Handlers are **not required** for credential transport and SHOULD NOT duplicate auth business logic.

Authenticated requests to Nest CV endpoints SHALL send the short-lived **access token** from auth JSON responses in `Authorization: Bearer` (and **SHALL NOT** depend on browser cookies for establishing that identity). Refresh uses the documented JSON refresh contract (for example `POST /auth/refresh` with a refresh token from the client store), not `Set-Cookie`.

#### Scenario: Cross-origin API access

- **WHEN** the web app is served from an origin different from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- **THEN** preflight and actual auth and CV requests MUST succeed when the browser origin is listed in the API’s CORS allowlist and the client sends `Authorization` as required

#### Scenario: Proximity to access token expiry

- **WHEN** the client detects that the access credential is nearing expiry according to TTL rules agreed with `apps/api` (for example expiry within roughly one minute)
- **THEN** the client SHALL call the documented renewal endpoint before invoking other protected Nest operations, or SHALL surface session expired guidance if renewal fails or returns unauthorized

#### Scenario: Authenticated API error handling

- **WHEN** the API returns a non-OK response
- **THEN** `apiFetch` SHALL surface a clear error string, including concatenated validation messages when present

### Requirement: The CV editor SHALL persist resume sections through item-scoped API helpers

The web client in `apps/web/src/lib/cv-item-api.ts` (and related helpers) SHALL expose typed functions for each item operation defined in `cv-rest-api` (basics patch, array CRUD, nested highlight/course CRUD). Array-item update and delete helpers SHALL accept the item row UUID (`itemId`) rather than a numeric array index. Item mutation helpers SHALL NOT accept or send a `version` field. The dashboard CV editor SHALL call these functions on per-item Save and confirmed Delete instead of deferring resume body changes to a single Save CV action. After update or delete, local section state SHALL be merged by matching item `id`; after create, the client SHALL incorporate the returned item (with `id`) and refresh section ordering via section GET or equivalent sort logic.

#### Scenario: Saving a language entry

- **WHEN** a user saves a language from the inline edit form
- **THEN** the client SHALL invoke the language update helper with the CV id, the language row id, and payload only
- **AND THEN** on success SHALL replace the matching entry in local section state by `id` from the response

#### Scenario: Deleting an award entry

- **WHEN** a user confirms deletion of an award
- **THEN** the client SHALL call the award delete helper with the award row id
- **AND THEN** on success SHALL remove the entry from local state by `id` without requiring a full section refetch

### Requirement: The SPA routes SHALL expose landing, auth, and dashboard CV workflows

The App Router under `src/app/` MUST provide public entry and auth pages (`/`, `/login`, `/register`), a dashboard shell, CV list, new CV (`/dashboard/cv/new`), and per-CV view/edit (`/dashboard/cv/[id]`) backed by shared CV UI components. The per-CV editor SHALL organize authoring tabs per `cv-editor-ui`, use item-level persistence for resume content, and SHALL continue to upload profile photos through authenticated Nest **`POST /media/upload`** via `uploadResumeMedia`. Rich-text editors SHALL NOT expose separate image-upload tooling.

The new CV route (`/dashboard/cv/new`) SHALL NOT call `POST /cv` on page load. It SHALL render a simplified create form collecting JSON Resume `basics` fields only—**without** a separate CV title field. The client SHALL invoke `createCv` with resume `data` containing `basics` only (no `meta`) when the user activates an explicit Save (or Create) control; the API SHALL derive `cv.title` from the submitted basics. On successful create, the UI SHALL navigate to `/dashboard/cv/:id` for full editing. Navigating away or canceling before Save SHALL NOT create a CV row.

The per-CV editor bootstrap (`GET /cv/:id`) SHALL merge slim `data.basics` into local editor state and SHALL NOT depend on `data.meta` or `meta.version` for saves.

#### Scenario: User creates and edits a CV in the UI

- **WHEN** a signed-in user navigates dashboard flows
- **THEN** the UI SHALL load CVs through `listCvs`, `getCv`, `createCv`, and `deleteCv`, and SHALL mutate resume sections through item-scoped helpers matching the REST contract
- **AND** SHALL NOT read or write `data.meta` for concurrency or display

#### Scenario: User uploads a profile photo used in resumes

- **WHEN** a signed-in user selects a file in the Basics profile photo control and saves basics
- **THEN** the client SHALL call `uploadResumeMedia` when uploading a file, assign the returned API URL to `basics.image`, persist basics via the basics patch helper, and surface descriptive errors on failure

#### Scenario: User opens new CV without saving

- **WHEN** a signed-in user visits `/dashboard/cv/new` and leaves without clicking Save
- **THEN** the client SHALL NOT have called `POST /cv` for that visit
- **AND THEN** no new CV row SHALL appear in the dashboard list attributable to that visit

#### Scenario: User creates CV from simplified form

- **WHEN** a signed-in user fills basics on `/dashboard/cv/new` and clicks Save
- **THEN** the client SHALL call `createCv` once with resume `data` containing the entered `basics` only
- **AND THEN** on success SHALL navigate to `/dashboard/cv/:id` for the created CV with a server-derived title visible in the shell and list
