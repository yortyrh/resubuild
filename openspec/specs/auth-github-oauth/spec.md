# auth-github-oauth Specification

## Purpose

TBD - created by archiving change add-github-login. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The web SPA MUST provide a GitHub sign-in button

**Previously:** `redirectTo: \`${APP_URL}/auth/callback\``—`APP_URL`was derived inline in`oauth.ts`from`window.location.origin`.

**Now:** `redirectTo` is built via `authCallbackUrl()` from the new `apps/web/src/lib/auth/app-url.ts` helper, which resolves `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (with `window.location.origin` fallback). All other language in the requirement and scenarios is unchanged.

### Requirement: The `/auth/callback` server route MUST redirect to the public origin after exchanging the GitHub-issued code

The `GET /auth/callback` server route handler in `apps/web/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` runs on the server after GitHub redirects the browser back. The post-exchange redirect to `/dashboard` (or to the `?next=` query param if present) and the error redirect to `/login?error=…` MUST be built from `getAppUrl(request.nextUrl.origin)` (defined in `apps/web/src/lib/auth/app-url.ts`), which prefers `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and falls back to the request origin when the env var is unset. This prevents the browser from being redirected to the internal container origin (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`) when the app is deployed behind a reverse proxy or port mapping, which would otherwise put the internal origin in the address bar and break user-facing URLs.

#### Scenario: Callback in production returns the public origin in the address bar

- **WHEN** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://app.resubuild.dev` and the request hits the Next.js server via the internal container address `http://localhost:8080`
- **THEN** the route's success redirect SHALL be `Location: https://app.resubuild.dev/dashboard`
- **AND** the route's error redirect SHALL be `Location: https://app.resubuild.dev/login?error=…`

#### Scenario: Callback in local dev returns the request origin

- **WHEN** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is unset and the request hits the Next.js server via `http://localhost:3000`
- **THEN** the route's success redirect SHALL be `Location: http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

### Requirement: The SPA MUST complete the GitHub PKCE redirect via the existing `/auth/callback` page

The existing `/auth/callback` page SHALL handle the GitHub PKCE redirect by calling `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)` (or by relying on the Supabase client's automatic hash/query handling for `signInWithOAuth` returns) and SHALL then redirect the user to the post-login destination (the `?next=` query param if present, otherwise `/dashboard`). The callback page SHALL NOT branch on provider — the same code path handles the magic-link and GitHub redirects.

#### Scenario: GitHub returns to the callback with a valid code

- **WHEN** the browser navigates to `<APP_URL>/auth/callback` after GitHub authorises the app and a Supabase session is established
- **THEN** the SPA SHALL redirect to `/dashboard` (or to the `?next=` query param if present)
- **AND** the session SHALL be persisted via the same `apiFetch` path the magic-link flow already uses

#### Scenario: Callback is invoked without a code

- **WHEN** the user navigates to `<APP_URL>/auth/callback` with no `code` parameter
- **THEN** the SPA SHALL redirect to `/login?error=missing_code`
- **AND** the `/login` page SHALL render a non-blocking error explaining the sign-in could not be completed

### Requirement: The Supabase project MUST be configured to accept GitHub as an external provider

`supabase/config.toml` MUST contain an `[auth.external.github]` block with `enabled = true` and `client_id` / `secret` values sourced from environment variables (`env(GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID)` and `env(GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET)`) — the secrets MUST NOT be hard-coded in the committed config. The existing `[auth].additional_redirect_urls` MUST already include `<APP_URL>/auth/callback`; no new entry is required for the GitHub flow.

The `scripts/lib/local-env-composer.mjs` MUST write stub values for `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET` to `supabase/.env` on first run so `supabase start` does not fail; the stubs MUST be clearly marked as non-functional (e.g. `github-oauth-stub`).

#### Scenario: Local Supabase stack starts with the provider enabled

- **WHEN** the operator runs `supabase start` with the default `supabase/.env`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL resolve the `env(...)` references from `supabase/.env`
- **AND** Supabase SHALL log that the GitHub provider is enabled (with the stub `client_id`)

#### Scenario: Operator supplies real GitHub OAuth credentials

- **WHEN** the operator sets `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET` to real values in `supabase/.env` (or the cloud dashboard)
- **THEN** `signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'github' })` from the SPA SHALL redirect to a live GitHub authorisation screen
- **AND** the resulting Supabase-issued JWT SHALL validate against the existing Bearer-token guard in `apps/api` without any code change on the API side

#### Scenario: Operator does not supply real credentials

- **WHEN** the operator leaves the stub `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET` in place
- **THEN** the GitHub button MAY render (if `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_GITHUB_OAUTH_ENABLED=true`) but `signInWithOAuth` SHALL fail
- **AND** the SPA SHALL surface the "Sign-in failed" toast described above
- **AND** the API SHALL remain unaffected

### Requirement: The GitHub flow MUST produce a JWT that the existing API guard accepts without modification

`apps/api`'s `SupabaseAuthGuard` SHALL continue to validate the access token issued by the GitHub PKCE flow with no provider-specific code path. The guard already calls `supabase.auth.getUser` with the service-role key, which is provider-agnostic. The API SHALL NOT introduce a new endpoint, guard, or middleware specific to the GitHub provider.

#### Scenario: API call with a GitHub-issued access token

- **WHEN** the SPA stores a session obtained via the GitHub flow and sends `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to a guarded route (e.g. `GET /cv`)
- **THEN** the API SHALL validate the token and respond with the protected resource, identical to the password or magic-link flows
